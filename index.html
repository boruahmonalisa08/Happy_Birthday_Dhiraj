	     	My dear Jaan,<br>On this special day, my heart and soul are in awe of the person you are and the strong-willed woman you have made me become. May you receive all the happiness, wealth and health in the world. <br>I am missing you terribly and I wish I was with you today. So, I have decided to do something new for your birthday but you also know that I am not that good at this thing. But I have tried my best to make it a bit special.<br><div class = "yours" align="right"> Yours only Mousumi</div>

			<h2>Do You Know Why I love You so much?</h2>

			Because you are my kind of perfect.<br>Because you are the only one whom I can trust blindly.<br>Because the way you make me feel no one else can.<br>Because your love is unconditional.<br>Because we have a soul-to-soul connection.<br>Because our bond is beyond love.<br>Because you are the only one who can handle my mood swings.<br>Finally I don't need to give any reason beacuse You are mine and mine only.....<br>
