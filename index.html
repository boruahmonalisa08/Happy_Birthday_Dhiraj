May you receive all the happiness, wealth and health in the world. <br>I am missing you terribly and I wish I was with you today. So, I have decided to do something new for your birthday but you also know that I am not that good at this thing. But I have tried my best to make it a bit special.<br><div class = "yours" align="right"> Yours only Mousumi</div>

			<h2>Our Story</h2>
		    <p>It was 11th of August 2017, the first day I saw you and my feeling was "Iman cute lora tu. Girlfriend tu asei sage. Dekhat tu valei ghoror jen lagise. But muk ba ki vabibo moi tu aku a najanu". Then slowly we started chatting each other. And yeah, it is true that I started feeling for you but I was not sure whether you felt the same for me. But on 19th of August 2017, you somehow expressed your feeling for me and the way you held my hand it was mesmerizing and Literally I felt like I was waiting for this day only since long. Now see our destiny, It's almost 3 years and our bond is getting even more stronger day by day.<br> Then we started talking for 4-5 hours every night, now I feel like how did we attended all those classes every morning after such long talk. The way you stared at me in the class was really cute. I always wanted to sit with you in the class but you were so shy.<br>And then slowly we started to study together. A secret I never told you is that I used to make excuses to go to the Dean's building so that I can spend the weekend with you. Actually my plan was never to study but to be with you. Then it became our habit.<br>I have never ever met a human being like you who is so descent, innocent, gentle, shy sometimes, intelligent, hard working, mature and yeah horny. It took me a lot of time to understand you but as now I know you I found that you are so pure inside and outside. The best thing about you is you never fake anything. The way you handle every situation is really awesome.<br> We use to fight very much and it is also true that most of the time beacuse of my fault. But you are the one who always says sorry first. I also remember the day when you came to the bus stand to just say sorry to me and you sat on your knees that day and it was the first time that a person did that for me. But it is your fault that you love me so much and spoilt me this way.<br>Jaan our story is not like a fairy tale or anything, it is something very different and special for me. And the only reason that our bond is so strong is you. I am really very proud of you and us together. And I can't share you with anyone else. You are mine and you will be mine always. Never ever leave me.<br> Today I pray for you to achieve everything you desire and I know your hardwork will never ever go in vain. No matter whatever may be the situation you will always find me I promise. I promise to never ever leave you alone in any situation.<br> I LOVE YOU TO THE MOON AND BACK.</p>
